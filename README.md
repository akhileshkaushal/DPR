# DPR: Non-parametric genetic prediction of complex traits with latent Dirichlet process regression models

DPR is the software implementing the latent Dirichlet Process Regression (DPR) model for robust genetic prediction of complex traits with typed genotypes. While most existing GWAS prediction models use parametric priors, DPR makes use of a flexible non-parametric prior on the SNPs effect sizes. By using a non-parametric model, DPR is adaptive to a broad spectrum of genetic architectures and can achieve robust predictive performance for a variety of complex traits. DPR can be fitted using two complementary algorithms: the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm, and the mean filed variational Bayesian (VB) approximation algorithm.

Currently, DPR is only supported for Linux platform.
